## About

The File editor, formerly known as Configurator, is a small web-app (you access it via web browser) that provides a
filesystem-browser and text-editor to modify files on the machine the File editor is
running on.

It is powered by Ace editor, which supports syntax highlighting for various
code/markup languages. YAML files (the default language for Home Assistant
configuration files) will be automatically checked for syntax errors while editing.

## Features

- Web-based editor to modify your files with syntax highlighting and YAML linting.
- Upload and download files.
- Stage, stash and commit changes in Git repositories, create and switch between
  branches, push to remotes, view diffs.
- Lists with available entities, triggers, events, conditions and services.
- Restart Home Assistant directly with the click of a button. Reloading groups,
  automations, etc. can be done as well. An API password is required.
- Direct links to Home Assistant documentation and icons.
- Execute shell commands within the add-on container.
- Editor settings are saved in your browser.
- And much moreâ€¦

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

ssh_keys: []
```

### Option: `dirsfirst` (required)

This option allows you to list directories before files in the file browser tree.

Set it to `true` to list directories first, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `enforce_basepath` (required)

If set to `true`, access is limited to files within the `/config` directory.

### Option: `ignore_pattern` (required)

This option allows you to hide files and folders from the file browser tree.
By default, it hides the `__pycache__` folders.

### Option: `ssh_keys` (required)

A list of filenames containing SSH private keys. These can be used to allow for access to remote git repositories.
